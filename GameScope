Concept Summary (Open to ideas)
  Overall:
    - 3D platformer
    - Light RPG elements
  Description:
    - A world where there is a known gauntlet challenge of 'The Tower'.
      'The Tower'
          - consists of 'zones'
          - Zones begin easy with little to no environment hazards. As the player reaches new zones, different vertically oriented environments are revealed. 
            Ex. Grassland/forest/snow mountain/firey circle
          - Starting zone will require no additional movement skills/magic/tools from the starting mechanic
          - Zones will have multiple vertical paths leading to the next zone
          - Depending on what path the player takes, new skills/magic/tools will be unlocked.
          - Maybe dynamic weather / night&day cycle determine pathing and can open up new paths (moonlight revealing/rain enables slides for speed-up, dry for climbing?)
